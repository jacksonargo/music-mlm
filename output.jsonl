{"context":"In auditory perception, notes begin and decay. A stream of sound radiating from a source may be dampened by air or obstructed by objects, attenuating frequencies, before reaching a perceiver. The perceiver’s physical position – distance, angle, in light or shade – determines what patterns may be perceived. Every percept is embodied. Bodies, their potential for psychophysical experience and subjectivity, dictate what is perceived in the environment as well as what is done as a result of perceiving that information. Varela, Thompson and Rosch (1993) assert a perceiver’s embodiment is its fundamental connection to its environment. Gibson referred to the combination of factors that determine what is detected as the perceiver’s ‘vantage’ ([1979] 1986).","question":"What determines what audio patterns may be perceived?","answers.text":"physical position – distance, angle, in light or shade","answers.answers_start":212}
{"context":"It may not be an overstatement to say that classical recording studios are mysterious spaces – producers and sound engineers often call their work a ‘black art’. For decades, the practices of, and discourses around, classical recording have been ones of self-effacement: we are not meant to be aware of anything that might get in the way of the transmission of the composer’s work, via the performer, to the listener.
