"The important point is this: the first person hired for postproduction sound will be the supervisor. Some films have a sound designer and a supervising sound editor. The two positions have different tasks. The sound designer is responsible for very specific conceptual sound effects, and the supervising sound editor is the team leader for the rest of the sound crew.",What is the sound designer responsible for?,very specific conceptual sound effects,250

Audio processing equipment such as equalization and compression were developed in the early part of the twentieth century. Equalization originated as a technological solution to maintain spectral consistency and clarity over long-distance telephone lines by compensating for high-frequency losses.,When were equalization and compression developed?,early part of the twentieth century,87
"In auditory perception, notes begin and decay. A stream of sound radiating from a source may be dampened by air or obstructed by objects, attenuating frequencies, before reaching a perceiver. The perceiver’s physical position – distance, angle, in light or shade – determines what patterns may be perceived. Every percept is embodied. Bodies, their potential for psychophysical experience and subjectivity, dictate what is perceived in the environment as well as what is done as a result of perceiving that information. Varela, Thompson and Rosch (1993) assert a perceiver’s embodiment is its fundamental connection to its environment. Gibson referred to the combination of factors that determine what is detected as the perceiver’s ‘vantage’ ([1979] 1986).",What determines what audio patterns may be perceived?,"physical position – distance, angle, in light or shade",212
"It may not be an overstatement to say that classical recording studios are mysterious spaces – producers and sound engineers often call their work a ‘black art’. For decades, the practices of, and discourses around, classical recording have been ones of self-effacement: we are not meant to be aware of anything that might get in the way of the transmission of the composer’s work, via the performer, to the listener. The producers, engineers, and by extension conductors and performers, have by and large aimed for a simulation of a ‘best seat in the house’ concert experience, with no sense given of how this was achieved",Recording producers aim for what kind of experience?,best seat in the house,546
"Groove is a musical term used by musicians, fans and academics alike. It is used (as a noun) to name a characteristic rhythmic pattern typical of a musical style (i.e. swing groove, rock groove, funk groove) but also (as is reflected in the adjective ‘groovy’) to evoke the particular pleasurable quality of, as well as the appeal to dance and motion emanating from, such patterns when they are performed well.1 Producing a groove thus involves more than creating the correct rhythmic pattern; it entails the detailed manipulation of the ‘analogue aspects’ (Kvifte 2007) of rhythm – that is, features such as microtiming, choice and processing of sounds, and so on.",What is groove?,a characteristic rhythmic pattern typical of a musical style,102

"Record production as a practice is little more than a century old and responds to societal and technological shifts. It is only in the past two decades or so that a theoretical analysis of production (inde- pendent of technical considerations) has emerged as a field of academic study within the broader disciplines of ethnomusicology, musicology, and anthropology. Classifi cation is an ancient practice and perhaps the most fundamental of scientifi c interpretive tools, although it is complex, ever changing, and sometimes controver- sial with regard to common criteria chosen for inclusion in a category",How old is record production?,little more than a century old,35

"The location in the stereo or surround field is controlled by the pan pot, which, like the fader, is a simple level control device. We localize discrete mix elements of the mix toward the pan-pot-specified louder location. Hard-panned tracks, for which the pan pot is turned fully to one side or the other, come entirely from one loudspeaker and listeners will reliably localize that sound at that location. As we back off the hard-panned setting to one that it is, for example, slightly louder in the left speaker than the right, a perceptual illusion of location between speakers is created.",What controls the location of in the stereo or surround field?,the pan pot,62

"We pan core instruments such as the vocal, the snare, the kick drum, and the bass to the center, not just for reasons of aesthetics—many songs make sense when they are in the center—but also for reasons of reliability and audibility: panning these tracks to the center means that they are coming out of both the left and right loudspeakers at the same level. The hope is that no matter where anyone sits, in any room, on any system, these key tracks will still be relatively audible, keeping the overall mix therefore relatively reliable across systems. For vinyl releases, center panning has the added benefit that low frequencies are less likely to toss the needle out of the groove than a hard-panned low- frequency signal.",What instruments are panned to the center?,"the vocal, the snare, the kick drum, and the bass",32

"The net sum of all your panning decisions across all the tracks in the multitrack project must lead to a fairly equal use of the left and right sides, and it typically sits more in the front than in the rear.",What must panning decisions sum to?,fairly equal use of the left and right sides,107
"The standard disclaimer appears here, of course: the only rule in music is that there are no rules in music. Tell an artist what they shouldn't do, and that is what they will most want to do. So if you are feeling a passionate desire to make a rear-heavy surround mix that pulls off to the right, feel free to do so if you have a compelling reason to do so.",what is the only rule in music?,there are no rules in music,107
"The most flexible type of equalizer is the parametric equalizer, so called because it provides three adjustable parameters for altering the spectral shape of any audio signal. The other types of equalizers have just one or two of these three parameters, so mastering these three parameters makes understanding all other types of equalizers much easier. When you learn how to use a parametric equalizer, you are pretty much learning how to use all types of equalizers.",what is the most flexible equalizer?,parametric equalizer,43

"Having aimed for the desired frequency range, you determine how much to alter its amplitude by adjusting a second parameter called cut/boost or gain. This control determines the amount of decrease or increase in amplitude at the center frequency chosen via the frequency selection parameter mentioned previously. To reduce the shrillness of a brassy horn track, select a high frequency (perhaps around 8 kHz) and cut it by a small amount (maybe about 3 dB).",what does gain determine?,amount of decrease or increase in amplitude at the center frequency,180

"The Q describes the frequency width of the cut or boost region. It is perhaps counterintuitive, but the industry standard is that a small value for Q indicates a wide spectral area being boosted. A large value for Q specifies a narrower, more specific area of influence. Engineers frequently say “low Q” and “high Q” to describe wide and narrow equalization settings, respectively.",what does the q describe?,frequency width of the cut or boost region,21
